## Getting started


2.  `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3.  in Command line: `export FLASK_APP=waste_app.py`
4.  Try: `printenv FLASK_APP`
5.  Output: `waste_app.py`
6. `flask run`

# <a name="a"></a>Inspiration
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Landfills are one of the largest producers of Methane and 
house gases. Even power generation from Waste produces CO2. Why is it a big problem? It is because of no proper way in dumping. All kind of wastes are dumped which leads to half degrading and pollution of local resources.Dumping of huge amount of waste also causes soil contamination,Water contamination,Air contamination and causes harm for marine and animal life. 


# <a name="b"></a> What it does
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  
  


We have started out with a flask app for classifying types of waste. Later we decided to implement a better front end experience.

Latest technologies like Deep Learning for Waste classification, web applications ensure the application detects waste correctly.

# <a name="c"></a> How we built it
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have built this system as Web App. Entire frontend is built using HTML,CSS,JS. 
  
# <a name="c"></a> CNN
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is Deep Neural Networks which will recognize and classify particular features from images and are widely used for analyzing visual images.
Convolutional Neural Networks are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features, from low- to high-level patterns.

# <a name="c"></a> DENSENET
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DenseNet is a convolutional neural network wherever every layer is connected to all or any different layers that are deeper within the network.

# <a name="c"></a> RESNET
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Residual Network (ResNet) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that overcame the “vanishing gradient” problem, making it possible to construct networks with up to thousands of convolutional layers.
